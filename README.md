# Dotfiles (Brouca Pierre)

My OS X dotfiles, based on [Nicolas Gallagher's dotfiles](https://github.com/necolas/dotfiles)

## How to install

The installation step requires the [XCode Command Line
Tools](https://developer.apple.com/downloads) and may overwrite existing
dotfiles in your HOME and `.vim` directories.

```bash
$ bash -c "$(curl -fsSL raw.github.com/broucz/dotfiles/master/bin/dotfiles)"
```

N.B. If you wish to fork this project and maintain your own dotfiles, you must
substitute my username for your own in the above command and the 2 variables
found at the top of the `bin/dotfiles` script.

## How to update

You should run the update when:

* You make a change to `~/.dotfiles/git/gitconfig` (the only file that is
  copied rather than symlinked).
* You want to pull changes from the remote repository.
* You want to update Homebrew formulae and Node packages.

Run the dotfiles command:

```bash
$ dotfiles
```
